# ABOUT

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

Here's a special README listing the programming languages I master and the projects I'm involved in. But first, a brief presentation.

I'm a French student who loves programming projects, hacking and quantum physics. I also spend too much time doing nothing on my computer and playing video games. Oh, and I almost forgot, I tinker (a bit too much) with servers at home, to the point where they end up being reset after 24 hours.
